A production-ready computer vision system for real-time object detection and multi-object tracking, built with YOLOv8 and Streamlit. This project demonstrates clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and modern ML engineering practices.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection** - YOLOv8-powered detection with adjustable confidence thresholds
- **Multi-Object Tracking** - Persistent object tracking across frames with unique IDs
- **Multiple Input Sources** - Support for webcam streams, video files, and static images
- **Interactive Web UI** - Clean Streamlit interface with real-time parameter adjustment
- **Performance Optimization** - Frame skipping, model caching, and IOU threshold tuning
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 71 tests with 94% code coverage
- **Production-Ready** - Type hints, error handling, logging, and configuration management

## Technologies

- **Python 3.10+** - Modern Python with full type hint support
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** - State-of-the-art object detection
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision and video processing
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web interface
- **pytest** - Comprehensive testing framework (94% coverage)

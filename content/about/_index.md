Cybersecurity professional specializing in Identity and Access Management (IAM/PAM) and zero-trust security frameworks.

I've resolved critical infrastructure outages preventing significant revenue loss, automated server configurations that cut manual labor by 80%, and collaborated on prototyping AI-driven IAM solutions using natural language processing.

## What I Do

Beyond consulting, I run a homelab for hands-on experimentation with self-hosted services, security tooling, and infrastructure automation. I leverage Claude Code for development workflows and n8n for building custom automation pipelines.

I'm deeply involved in Finland's cybersecurity community: organizing CitySec speaker events, helped build the Community Village at Disobey, and previously serving as board chair for Cluster ry at LUT University.

## What I Bring

Practical security implementation, automation scripting, incident response experience, and a track record of turning complex security requirements into working solutions that teams actually use.
